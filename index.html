    <h2>Background of the Problem</h2>
    <!-- Paragraph explaining climate change issues in the Philippines -->
    <p>
      Climate change presents significant challenges to development in the
      Philippines. Between 2002 and 2024, the country lost 196 thousand hectares
      of humid primary forest, accounting for 13% of its total tree cover loss
      during that period. The overall area of humid primary forest diminished by
      4.3% in these years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, from 2001 to 2024, the Philippines lost 1.52 million hectares
      of tree cover, representing 8.2% of the total tree cover area in 2000,
      along with 928 million metric tons of CO₂ equivalent emissions. Without
      intervention, climate change could lead to a 13.6% reduction in GDP by
      2040, with the most vulnerable households being hit the hardest.

      <h2>What's Being Done Now</h2>
      <!-- Paragraph about youth leading climate action -->
      <p>
        Young people in the Philippines are emerging as powerful agents of
        change, using digital platforms to lead climate action. Initiatives like
        the 2030 Youth Force Philippines engage nearly half of the country’s
        population to make the Sustainable Development Goals a reality through
        education, activation, and collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Climate Change Commission promotes digital innovation among youth,
        encouraging the use of online platforms for awareness and advocacy. Youth
        voices have been recognized by the Quezon City Government and UNICEF,
        highlighting their leadership in collective climate action campaigns.

        The Gen Green Movement website is designed to inform, engage, and empower
        the youth of the Philippines to participate actively in climate action.
        By highlighting real data, youth-led projects, and opportunities to act,
        we motivate users to become advocates for climate action within their
        communities.
